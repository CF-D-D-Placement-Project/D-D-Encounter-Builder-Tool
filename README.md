# D-D-Encounter-Builder-Tool

This tool is designed to aid Dungeon Masters in creating 'balanced' monsters for the most famous role-playing game in the world "Dungeons and Dragons".

You are able to enter in the name of your adventuring party along with their Classes and Levels to keep the information for later use.

When designating your desired encounter, please include all of the Characters and their levels to help determine what their relative power is.
Next, designate how difficult you would like the encounter to be as well as how many monsters to fight.
You are able to include options such as "One-Shot" protection to prevent a monster from being designed that is so powerful it can inadvertantly kill a character in a single hit.
The page will generate a series of monsters with randomized statistics that can be used to challenge your players.
